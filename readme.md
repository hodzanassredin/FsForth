This is Richard WM Jones's literate x86 assembly implementation of Forth reimplemented in F#.

All features exclude linux syscals are implemented. 

When you are starting forth learning the most interesting part is how to build forth vm from scratch.
Jonesforth is one of the best implementations and tutorial at the same time.
Unfortunately it is hard sometimes to understand assembler code so fsForth is an attempt to made it more clear for developer without deep assembler knowledge.

You just need to open ["jonesforth.fs](https://github.com/hodzanassredin/FsForth/blob/master/FsForth/jonesforth.fs) and start reading.

if you wonna play with forth then install dotnet core and exec run.cmd(on windows) or ./run.sh on linux.
